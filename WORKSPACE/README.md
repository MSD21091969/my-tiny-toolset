# Research Workspace

**Last updated:** 2025-10-17

Personal research area for exploring subjects, testing ideas, and developing knowledge.

## Current Contents

- `FIELDNOTES.md` - Ongoing research findings, domain references, workflow commands
- `20251016_user_manual.md` - Data-first AI architecture documentation
- Session reports and development progress tracking
- ADK experiment findings and architectural validation

## Structure

### [field-notes/](field-notes/)
Daily research notes, exploration findings, insights from submodule research

### [experiments/](experiments/)
Test code, proof-of-concepts, validation scripts

### [drafts/](drafts/)
Work-in-progress documents before they move to REFERENCE/

## Workflow

1. **Research Phase** - Explore submodules, take notes in field-notes/
2. **Experiment Phase** - Test ideas, validate concepts in experiments/
3. **Draft Phase** - Structure findings in drafts/
4. **Publish Phase** - Move validated content to REFERENCE/SUBJECTS/

## Guidelines

- Keep workspace messy - it's for exploration
- Date your field notes
- Reference sources in experiments
- Move things out regularly to keep it focused
